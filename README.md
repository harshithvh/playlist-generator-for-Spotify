# About

---

Spotify is a Swedish audio streaming and media services provider founded on 23 April 2006 by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. It is the world's largest music streaming service provider, with over 381 million monthly active users, including 172 million paying subscribers.

As Spotify was launched in 2006, before that if you wanted to listen to any music, you just had two options:

1. Buy the song from iTunes, and download it. (Legal)
2. Download the song's pirated copy. (Illegal)

At that time, the average cost of one album was $10, which is quite expensive. If you listen to 100 songs daily, then your total bill comes out to be $100 (considering 1 album have 10 songs). This is the reason why more than 50% of people used to download pirated copies.

Daniel Ek is the current CEO of Spotify and is co-founder of Spotify. Ek’s innovative business model for providing access to music online differed from other services in that it did not involve charging for song downloads. Spotify customers could listen to online streaming music for free if they were willing to allow display or audio advertising. For $5 or $10 a month in subscription fees, however, consumers could avoid the advertisements. In 2006, it become the only cheap and legal way of listening to music.

# The Problem

Spotify has multiple servers spread over the globe. These servers store the different songs.

If a user wants to listen to music, Spotify will generate a playlist (it could be random or according to user preferences). One thing is important for this generated playlist is that the user can only move to the next song or previous song. 

The songs are stored in several Spotify servers, instead of sending the whole song to the user’s device, its address is sent.

The code won’t actually play the song, but you will understand its backend.
